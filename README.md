# Top Five Countries by CAGR (2000-2023) with Populations Greater than 100M 

The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is a vital metric for evaluating the consistent economic performance of large countries with populations exceeding 100 million. These nations often represent a significant share of global economic activity, and their growth trajectories can influence regional and international markets. By measuring the smoothed annual growth rate over a specific period, CAGR provides a clear picture of economic expansion, accounting for fluctuations that may occur year to year. For countries with large populations, high CAGRs indicate successful strategies in leveraging their demographic advantage, fostering industries, attracting investments, and enhancing productivity. Understanding these growth patterns is essential for policymakers, investors, and global organizations aiming to identify opportunities, assess risks, and drive sustainable development in an increasingly interconnected world.

# Ethiopia (13.88% CAGR)
Ethiopia's exceptional growth was fueled by government-led industrialization and infrastructure development. Major investments in sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, and energy, combined with policies to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), created a robust foundation for growth. The country’s light manufacturing industries, particularly textiles, became globally competitive. Additionally, rapid urbanization and improvements in public health and education helped boost productivity and foster economic progress.

# China (12.39% CAGR)
China maintained its high growth rate through an aggressive combination of industrialization, urbanization, and export-led economic policies. Its accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 catalyzed its integration into global supply chains, boosting trade and investment. The country also diversified its economy, becoming a leader in technology and renewable energy production. Heavy investment in infrastructure and a focus on innovation allowed China to maintain high productivity and adapt to changing global market conditions.

# Indonesia (9.64% CAGR)
Indonesia’s growth was driven by its resource-rich economy, strategic investment in infrastructure, and expanding domestic market. The country capitalized on its abundant natural resources, including coal, palm oil, and natural gas, to boost exports. Structural reforms, such as improvements in governance and business regulation, attracted FDI. Additionally, its large, young population provided a growing labor force and consumer base, fostering both industrial and service-sector expansion.

# Bangladesh (9.58% CAGR)
Bangladesh’s economy thrived due to its booming garment and textile industry, which became a global leader in low-cost manufacturing. Government policies that supported trade liberalization and industrial zones helped attract international buyers. Alongside this, significant investments in rural development, microfinance, and social services, including education and health, enhanced productivity. The country’s strategic focus on women’s empowerment also played a pivotal role, integrating a large portion of the population into the workforce.

# Russia (9.33% CAGR)
Russia’s growth was largely driven by its energy sector, particularly oil and gas exports, which benefited from rising global commodity prices in the early 2000s. Investments in technology and defense sectors also contributed to economic diversification. Strategic trade partnerships and export-driven policies helped bolster its economy. Despite challenges like sanctions and fluctuating oil prices, strong domestic demand and reforms in key industries supported consistent growth.

# CAGR DAX Formula

To calculate the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for countries with populations exceeding 100 million as of 2023, I utilized population data from 2023 and GDP data spanning 2000-2023, both sourced through an API connection from the World Bank to Power BI. This streamlined data extraction ensured up-to-date and accurate information for analysis. Using Power BI, I visualized the data to identify growth trends and employed Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to compute the CAGR. The CAGR formula, defined as (FV / PV)^(1/n) - 1, where FV is the GDP in 2023, PV is the GDP in 2000, and n is the 23-year period, was implemented in DAX. This setup allowed me to dynamically calculate and compare CAGR across countries efficiently, leveraging automation to enhance both the precision and scalability of the analysis.
