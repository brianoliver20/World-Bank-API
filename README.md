# NATO Military Expenditure as Percent of GDP from 2014 to 2023

In recent years, the global landscape of military expenditure has evolved, reflecting shifting geopolitical priorities and economic realities. Military spending, as a percentage of GDP, is a critical indicator of how nations allocate resources for defense relative to their overall economic output. In 2014, NATO declared its intention to increase member nations' defense spending to at least 2% of their GDP by 2024, a move aimed at strengthening collective security amid growing global threats. This analysis examines the military expenditures of eight countries in 2014 and 2023, all of which had a total GDP exceeding 1 trillion USD in 2023. By comparing these two years, we can discern trends in defense priorities across major economies.
